# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model Using Machine Learning:

### What is Credit Card Fraud Detection?

Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses.

Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance. In banking, fraud may include forging checks or using stolen credit cards.

In this Python Project, we will detect if a Credit Card Transaction is Fraud or Not-Fraud.

I have worked with two algorithms:

 * Logistic Regression 

 * Naive Bayes classifier

Ypu can work with other Classifiers as well.

To predict the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.

# Aim:

The main aim of this  project is to build a classifier that can detect if credit card transaction is Fraud or Not-Fraud.
